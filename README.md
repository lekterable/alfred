# Moltbot / Clawdbot on Coolify

> **Personal template by [@RJuro](https://github.com/RJuro).** Assumes familiarity with Docker, Coolify, and command-line tools.

Deploy the [Clawdbot](https://molt.bot) gateway on [Coolify](https://coolify.io) with persistent configuration, auto-generated auth, and API key management.

## Quick Start

1. Fork this repo
2. In Coolify: **Add Resource** → **Docker Compose** → point to your fork
3. Set environment variables (see below)
4. Deploy

No manual `clawdbot setup` needed — the entrypoint auto-generates config and auth profiles from your environment variables.

## Environment Variables

Set these in your Coolify resource settings.

### Authentication (auto-generated if omitted)

| Variable | Required | Description |
|----------|----------|-------------|
| `CLAWDBOT_GATEWAY_PASSWORD` | Recommended | Gateway password for Control UI access |
| `CLAWDBOT_GATEWAY_TOKEN` | No | Token auth (alternative to password) |

If neither is set, a random token is auto-generated and printed in container logs.

### AI Provider Keys (at least one required)

| Variable | Provider |
|----------|----------|
| `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` | Anthropic (Claude) |
| `GOOGLE_API_KEY` | Google AI (Gemini) |
| `OPENAI_API_KEY` | OpenAI (GPT) |
| `OPENROUTER_API_KEY` | OpenRouter (multi-provider) |

### Channel Integrations (optional)

| Variable | Channel |
|----------|---------|
| `TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN` | Telegram |
| `DISCORD_BOT_TOKEN` | Discord |

## Architecture

- **Single service**: `clawdbot-gateway` on port 18789
- **Health check**: `curl http://localhost:18789/health` (30s interval, 60s startup grace)
- **Proxy labels**: Both Traefik and Caddy labels included for Coolify compatibility
- **Volumes**: Config persists across redeployments

## Volumes

| Volume | Container Path | Purpose |
|--------|---------------|---------|
| `clawdbot_state` | `/home/node/.clawdbot` | Config, sessions, auth profiles |
| `clawdbot_workspace` | `/home/node/clawd` | Workspace files |

## How It Works

The `entrypoint.sh` script:
1. Writes `clawdbot.json` gateway config from environment variables
2. Generates `auth-profiles.json` with any API keys provided
3. Configures `gateway.bind=lan` so the gateway is reachable from Coolify's proxy network
4. Starts the gateway with `--allow-unconfigured` as fallback

## Troubleshooting

**502 Bad Gateway**: Gateway not reachable from proxy.
- Check health: `docker exec <container> curl localhost:18789/health`
- Verify the container is on the `coolify` network
- Ensure `gateway.bind` is `lan` (handled automatically by entrypoint)

**503 Error**: Gateway process crashed. Check logs: `docker logs <container>`

**Config lost after redeploy**: Use **Redeploy** in Coolify, not delete + recreate. Named volumes persist across redeployments.

**No API keys warning**: Set at least one provider key (ANTHROPIC_API_KEY, GOOGLE_API_KEY, etc.) in Coolify environment variables.
